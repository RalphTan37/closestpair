# Finding the Closest Pair of Given Points in the Plane

The program contains a main driver that parses commandline arguments with the following form: </br>
```driver A N [S]``` </br>
where **A** is an integer with value 0,1, or 2 that designates the algorithm to be used, **N** is the number of the points in the data set, and **S** is an (optional) integer seed to the random-number generator, thereby allowing you to repeat trials on the same data set.
